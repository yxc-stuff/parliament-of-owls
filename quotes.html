                "A tree whose girth fills one's embrace sprang from a downy sprout; A terrace nine stories high arose from a layer of dirt; A journey of a thousand leagues began with a single step. Those who use it ruin it. Those who grab hold of it lose it. This is why sages practice nonaction and so do not ruin; They do not lay hold and so do not lose. People often ruin things just when they are on the verge of success. Be as careful at the end as you are the beginning and you will not ruin things. This is why sages desire to be without desires and show no regard for precious goods. They study what is not studied and return to what the multitude pass by. They work to support the myraid creatures in their natural condition and never dare to act."

                "In ancient times, those good at practicing the Way did not use it to enlighten the people, but rather to keep them in the dark. The people are hard to govern because they know too much. And so to rule a state with knowledge is to be a detriment to the state. Not to rule a state through knowledge is to be a blessing to the state."

                "The rivers and ocean are able to rule over a hundred valleys, because they are good at placing themselves in the lower position. And so they are able to rule over a hundred valleys. This is why if you want to be above the people you must proclaim that you are below them. If you want to lead the people, you must put yourself behind them. This is how sages are able to reside above the people without being considered a burden, How they are able to be out in front of the people without being regarded as a harm. This is why the whole world delights in supporting them and never wearies. Because they do not contend, no one in the world can contend with them. "
