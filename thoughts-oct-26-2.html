            <h1>Revisiting My Faith: Why I No Longer Believe God Is Just Us in the Future</h1>

            <p>After reflecting on my last piece—where I suggested that God might simply be a future version of humanity warning us about the consequences of failing to love one another—I've come to believe that idea was mistaken. The turning point came shortly after revising and preparing that essay for publication. Not long after my initial thoughts, I experienced an intense period of psychological turmoil that left me feeling hopeless. What helped restore my sense of peace was prayer—specifically, praying at St. Paul's Cathedral. That experience led me to reconsider my earlier views and to sense, quite deeply, that a higher power truly exists.</p>

            <p>I now believe that we were created by a being existing in a dimension beyond our own. Each of us serves a purpose: to learn how to love, to live in harmony with one another, and to embody those lessons within ourselves. When we do, we can ascend to a higher order of existence. This conviction emerged not from abstract theory but from lived experience—moments of despair and restoration that felt profoundly transformative.</p>

            <p>My experiences have taught me that disbelief or arrogance toward the divine leads to suffering, while humility and faith bring peace. However, this realisation also raises a paradox: if God expects us to fear Him and see Him as our saviour, is that not, in some sense, self-centred? This question brought me back to a perspective I've long held—that of the yin and yang. Nothing in existence is purely one moral quality or its opposite. Even goodness contains a trace of imperfection, and even the flawed can hold potential for light.</p>

            <p>In this view, God embodies the closest thing to true altruism—a being of immense love who nevertheless holds within Himself a small measure of what we might perceive as self-regard. Humanity, by contrast, begins life largely self-absorbed. Our spiritual task is to diminish that self-obsession and move closer to divine altruism. Those who refuse this journey, who place themselves above the divine, invite suffering and disconnection from love.</p>

            <p>Although I don't fully understand the nature of these experiences or the higher realms, I now see this life as an opportunity to grow spiritually—to learn, to love, and to strive toward harmony. In following that path, I've found a measure of peace that reason alone could not provide. Perhaps that is what it truly means to follow our Creator: to move beyond ourselves and toward a higher order of harmony and peace.</p>
