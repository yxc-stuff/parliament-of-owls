            <p>It feels like the world is split into two opposing forces. Whether in politics (left vs right), at work (… vs … teams), within groups (in-group vs out-group), within ourselves ("I should" vs "I shouldn't"), or globally (BRICS vs the West). There are always 2 sides that seem to fight against one another. One represents the emerging, ambitious, competitive force; the other represents the more established, calm, and slightly wiser one.</p>

            <p>The younger one always feels the need to fight and push through to get what they want, driven by ambition and the need to prove oneself. The older, having already secured what the younger seeks, tends to be calmer, more measured, and cooperative within their group.</p>

            <p>Maybe this is a fundamental structure of everything. Nature itself reflects this structure: day and night, creation and destruction, order and chaos. It seems like we need tension. Without tension, life loses its depth and movement. Everything flattens, like a 2D world, leaving us unable to feel. Contrast is what gives motion, emotion, and meaning.*</p>

            <p>However, in our modern world, we tend to dislike this tension. We resist against the fundamental opposing forces in social structures via ignoring/muting the opposing side and amplifying our stance. However, I think we should embrace this opposition rather than fighting against it. Just as we must listen to both the mind and the body, we should listen to both sides of any story.</p>

            <p>Because, like magnets, opposites attract in the end.</p>
