            <h2>Parallel Worlds</h2>
            <p>I feel like I've jumped into a parallel world.</p>
            
            <p>There are different outcomes in different worlds. There are many of these 3D worlds. Each with a different way it is designed by the creator.</p>
            
            <p>The creator is in a higher dimension than us. Maybe 4D.</p>
            
            <p><strong>My dad:</strong> "Even though our body is in 3D world, some people's 思维 (thinking) can go into 4D."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Through 修行 (spiritual cultivation), one's 思维 can enter 4D?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Do you think I've 修行成功了吗 (succeeded in cultivation)?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> Still in the process.</p>

            <h2>The Process of 修行</h2>
            <p>I am still in the process of 修行, as are people who want to 修行. With 修行, we should only focus on the process, not the end. We may reach the end, but that shouldn't be our everyday focus.</p>
            
            <p><strong>大方向 (Big direction):</strong> Reach the end.</p>
            <p><strong>小方向 (Small direction):</strong> Focus on everyday tasks.</p>
            
            <p>I meant that we need to keep our final goal in mind, but during our implementation process, we should just focus on every moment (every moment is something my dad came up with).</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                "Speaking to my dad helps with my thought process."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Harmony Between Humans and Nature</h2>
            <p>Human and nature live in harmony. It is not that things people created are necessarily bad. There are many good contributions that humans made to the world.</p>
            
            <p>Everything is grey. Nothing is completely black nor white. All the colors mixed together creates brown, the color of earth.</p>

            <h2>London and Great Thinkers</h2>
            <p>Why did so many great thinkers live in London? Parks in London feel like they're in harmony. Good for thinking. Many different pubs too for discussions of topics.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "Thinkers don't need to be affected by 功利的东西 (utilitarian things)."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "修行 faces many obstacles, but you can 越过它 (overcome them)."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me and my dad:</strong> 内心宁静才能助于修行 (Inner peace helps with cultivation).</p>

            <h2>仁: The Key to 修行</h2>
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> 仁 (benevolence) is the key to 修行.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Is this correct, dad?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "仁 is 孔夫子思想的核心 (the core of Confucius's thought), which equals 互相关爱 (mutual care for one another)."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> But I think 仁 = forgiveness.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> 仁 = forgiveness = 忍 = 互相关爱. (Draft 1)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "修行到一定境界后不存在忍 (After cultivating to a certain level, there is no need for 忍/endurance)."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, so it is: 仁 = forgiveness = 互相关爱.</p>

            <h2>History and the Present Moment</h2>
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "他们（British）人和自然之间不会互相争夺 (The British don't compete with nature)."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> But they competed with other people.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "That's history. History, we don't need to worry about it."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Yes, one should focus on what one is in control and has influence over (citing Marcus Aurelius and psychology).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "Sometimes we should forget about history and future and just enjoy the moment. History can't be changed, future has not come, so only this moment we can enjoy."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> This is exactly what I've always said: go with the flow.</p>

            <h2>Key Words That Guide Us</h2>
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Go with the flow. 平静致远 (Calmness leads to far-reaching goals). Calmness. Harmony. 修行.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "These are the key words. Sometimes we can't remember long articles, but we can remember key words that we instill in our thought and guide our action."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> But some other words are missing. I need to think of it a bit more. It's probably somewhere in the notes I wrote while I was in the psychiatric ward. I will think of it more when I get back.</p>

            <h2>Wealth and Purpose</h2>
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Let me take you to 有钱人的地方 (where the wealthy people are).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "That is the result of our successful 修行."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Hahahahaha! I can have all the money I want right now if I want. But I don't need all that. Big rooms make me feel it is too empty. Why do I need such a big room anyways?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "They are 商人 (businesspeople). They won't leave any words to this world."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> But I don't care about 留下只言片语 (leaving words behind). I don't want anyone to remember me as anything. Maybe this is why Confucius and Plato never wrote their own work. I don't care about making history at all. I don't want to be in any history books.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "Okay. That's very nice. That's life."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Why that's life? What does that mean?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "That is a philosophical question. 人生是用来enjoy的 (Life is meant to be enjoyed)."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> But I am not talking about hedonism. It is just about being humble and I am just a student. Yes, humbleness is another word I need to include in my list of words.</p>

            <h2>The Updated List</h2>
            <p><strong>Go with the flow. 平静致远. Calmness. Harmony. 修行. Humbleness.</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "Okay, very good."</p>

            <h2>Unconditional Love</h2>
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Look at them always throwing trash on the street (picking up trash). But I shouldn't focus too much on these things?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "Yes. Society is an organization, there are many departments that manage these things, otherwise the streets wouldn't be as we see them. Focus mainly on your own physical and mental health."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> As I said: unconditionally love oneself first, then give your unconditional love to others.</p>
            
            <p>Unconditional love = love without expecting anything in return.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "Yes, that's unconditional love."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> What is love?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "Love is 仁. Single character = 仁, two characters = 仁爱 (benevolence and love)."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> But 仁 can't be used for self-love though. I think self-love is something different. Unconditionally taking care of yourself without expecting anything in return. Do you understand that?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "Yes."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> No you don't. Do you understand it?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "Not totally, maybe a bit."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> Okay, I need to think of how to rephrase it. Using ChatGPT hahahahaha!</p>

            <h2>Weirdness as a Strength</h2>
            <p><strong>Me:</strong> When I walked by, someone said "she's just so weird."</p>
            
            <p>But I think that weirdness is what allows me to do the things I do.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Dad:</strong> "不要在意别人的comments (Don't pay attention to others' comments)."</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Go with the flow. 平静致远. Calmness. Harmony. 修行. Humbleness. Unconditional Love."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Oct 16 Update</h2>
            <p>I realised it is not about humbleness but rather being a student. Also edited some words out of my list</p>
            <p><strong>Calmness. Harmony. 修行. Studious. Unconditional Love.</strong></p>

            <h2>Oct 19 Update</h2>
            <p>Personally, I try to endure as much discomfort as I can before giving up and simply go with the flow. But everyone is different. These are just principles that guide my own life. They don’t have to guide yours, because each person’s purpose in life is unique.</p>
            <p>How to find one’s purpose? By living in harmony with all. Let peace and harmony for all be the shepherd that leads your way. This is the only way to never be astray.</p>
