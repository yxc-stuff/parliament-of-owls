            <p>Everything on Earth—humans, animals, nature, even concrete—has a magnetic field. Opposites attract, and these invisible forces draw us together, repel us, or disrupt our balance.</p>

            <p>In crowds, individual magnetic fields interfere with one another. That's why large groups can feel chaotic and dumber: more people means more noise, more disruption, less clarity.</p>

            <p>I often sense this magnetic pull with people close to me. For example, when I am walking with my dad. It feels like our fields influence each other's thoughts, emotions, and behaviour (e.g. mirroring one another's actions). Once two magnets attach, separating them takes effort.</p>

            <p>People are like magnets. Each of us carries a magnetic field that attracts, alters, disturbs, and synchronises with others around us. It's a bit different from a gravitational field, which simply pulls things toward it but remains unchanged by their presence, at least in the Newtonian sense. Even Einstein's theory, which shows how gravity bends spacetime, doesn't suggest that the field itself is disrupted by nearby masses. We, on the other hand, are constantly shaping and being shaped by the invisible forces we exchange with those around us. Thus, we each carry a magnetic, and not merely gravitational, field.</p>

            <p>When two people are truly in sync—physically, mentally, and emotionally—their fields align and they are drawn to one another. We can see this in behaviours like mirroring, when two people naturally fall into rhythm. Otherwise, it's not attraction. It's disruption. Like magnets that can't connect when their poles are misaligned, their energy spins restlessly, repelling each other until balance is restored. (I haven't found a video of this yet, but maybe one day I'll buy two bar magnets and demonstrate it so people can see what I mean by magnetics being out of sync and 登登登的甩来甩去.)</p>

            <p>Trading and financial markets behave in much the same way. It's the same fundamental dance of forces we see in the basic economic theory of demand and supply.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Attraction vs disruption lies in magnetic fields that we all have."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Role of Music, Buddhism and Meditation</h2>
            <p><strong>Music helps align these fields.</strong> When we listen deeply to the SAME piece of music—this is especially true of classical music played on instruments like the violin—we begin to synchronise: with the rhythm, with each other, and with the world.</p>

            <p><strong>simple act of chanting Aum</strong> (or Om Mani Padme Hum in Buddhism) focuses our energy and restores harmony within and around us, allowing our magnetic fields to attract and align with others and with the natural world.</p>

            <p><strong>Meditation works in a similar way.</strong> It shields us from the disruptive pull of other people's magnetic fields by attuning us to something larger: nature, stillness, or a collective calm.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on Myself and the Homeless</h2>
            <p>Sometimes I wonder if my resistance to others' pull, my need to protect my magnetic field, has caused friction. Maybe too much fluctuations in mood, in a sense, emerges when the balance between attraction and resistance breaks down. We need connection, yet we fear losing ourselves in it.</p>

            <p>Even those who seem disconnected, like the homeless, are still part of this magnetic web. When society rejects them, it's like breaking the natural chain of attraction. And something about that feels deeply wrong.</p>
