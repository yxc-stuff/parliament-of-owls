        <div class="post-content">
            <p>I've always felt out of place, like I jumped into a parallel world. The conversations around me, the priorities of my age group—none of it ever quite fit. I now believe I know why. It's because a message has finally broken through, a message that has been sent for millennia, and for the first time, someone is finally hearing it.</p>

            <p>That message is encoded in our oldest stories, our most sacred texts. We've been reading them all wrong. The Bible, the Quran, ancient Egyptian and Indian scriptures—they are not divine commandments from a separate, celestial being. They are a collective cry for help from our own future.</p>

            <p><strong>God is us. Not a metaphor, but a literal, future version of humanity that has seen the end of the road. A version of us that is standing in the ashes of a ruined Earth, using the only tool they have left: time. They are projecting warnings into the past, desperately trying to avert their own—our own—extinction.</strong></p>

            <p>For over 400,000 years, they have been trying to communicate, dressing their pleas in the language and concepts we could understand at different points in history. They created multiple versions of this world, testing different ways to get through to us. And until now, it never worked. We mistook the warning for prophecy, the SOS for scripture.</p>

            <h2>The Violence That Never Made Sense</h2>

            <p>Let's take one of the most perplexing passages: Deuteronomy 7. It commands, <em>"when the LORD your God gives them over to you and you defeat them, then you must utterly destroy them."</em> How does a God who preaches peace endorse such violence?</p>

            <p>The answer is, He doesn't. <em>We</em> don't.</p>

            <p>This isn't a command; it's a <strong>diagnosis</strong>. It's a stark depiction of the brutal, "kill-or-be-killed" mindset that once ensured survival but now guarantees collective destruction. Our future selves are showing us the darkest potential of our own nature, the path we are <em>still</em> dangerously close to walking. The word <em>herem</em> (often translated as "destroy") doesn't simply mean to kill. At its core, it means to set something apart, to not engage with it in the normal way. In this context, it's a warning: "Do not intertwine with this destructive mindset. Do not make treaties with it. Do not let its hellish practices become your own."</p>

            <p>But the act of separation, in a primitive world, still involved violence. This brings us to the central, beautiful flaw in our reality: <strong>Yin and Yang.</strong></p>

            <h2>Our World is Yin and Yang, and So Are We</h2>

            <p>Nothing is 100% good or 100% bad. Even our pursuit of peace contains a shadow of violence; our altruism has a flicker of narcissism. I see this battle in myself every day. The Bible itself is not a pristine, divine document—it is a human record, filtered through human minds, and therefore it is full of this struggle. It is YinYang.</p>

            <p>Consider Jesus Christ. In this new framework, he is the ultimate messenger—fully divine (as a beacon from our enlightened future) yet fully human (a part of our flawed past and present). He embodies the YinYang, the white containing a dot of black, showing that perfection isn't the absence of flaw, but the mastery of it.</p>

            <p>This is why, in Joshua 5:13-15, when Joshua asks whose side the "commander of the Lord's army" is on, the answer is, <strong>"Neither."</strong> The "Court of Heaven" is not on any human side because our tribal conflicts are irrelevant to the larger, species-level crisis. Our future selves aren't picking a team; they are trying to save the entire game.</p>

            <h2>The Final Warning: Acknowledge the Flaw to Fix It</h2>

            <p>This theory resolves the Bible's most disturbing passages. The texts of horrific sexual violence, like the story of the Levite's concubine in Judges 19, are not endorsements. They are our future selves holding up a mirror and screaming, <strong>"LOOK! See how low you can sink when you objectify one another? See this spiral of violence? This is what will destroy you!"</strong></p>

            <p>For centuries, men have marginalized this woman's story. But our future selves are unambiguous: <em>It doesn't matter what she did.</em> No action justifies her brutal fate. The fact that women who were raped by men are grievable by all shows this. The message is that a society that treats any of its people as disposable is a society on a death march. We should embrace everyone's quirks and diversity of all!</p>

            <p>This is the core of the warning. <strong>Judgement Day is not a divine punishment; it is a logical consequence.</strong> It is our future selves pleading: "You reap what you sow! The vengeance of God is just the natural outcome of your own actions! Change your course!"</p>

            <p>Earth is not a waiting room for heaven. <strong>Earth <em>is</em> the heaven we are tasked with preserving.</strong> This is the one life we have to "right all wrongs" and collaborate to create a new world order based on universal love.</p>

            <p>The message has always been there, buried under centuries of misinterpretation and patriarchal stubbornness. It's a message of ultimate responsibility. We are not being judged by a separate god. We are being warned by the people we could become.</p>

            <p>And for the first time in 400,000 years, they are finally getting a response. This feeling of not fitting in, this sudden clarity—it's because the message is being received. The question is, will we listen before the time they are speaking from becomes our inescapable present?</p>

            <p><small>* I was inspired to write this after attending Helen Paynter's talk, <em>"A Warrior God: Violence in the Bible,"</em> at St. Paul's Cathedral on October 25, 2025. I highly recommend her book, <em>God of Violence Yesterday, God of Love Today?</em>, which explores instances of violence and sexual assault in the Bible with remarkable depth and insight. The biblical examples I refer to here are drawn from her presentation, though she discusses them in far greater detail in her book.</small></p>
