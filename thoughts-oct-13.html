            <h2>Every Rock Speaks a Different Message</h2>
            <p>Each rock offers a unique message. Every rock presents a message. A message is with every rock. Every rock delivers a different conversation.</p>

            <h2>The Wind's Whispers</h2>
            <p>The wind whispers through autumn leaves. You can hear the whispers of the wind through the autumn leaves. The gentle wind caresses the autumn leaves and delivers messages through its whispers.</p>

            <h2>The Music of Friction</h2>
            <p>The concrete makes music when in friction with the foot. The concrete and the shoes make music using friction. Friction creates music between the shoes and the concrete.</p>
            
            <p>The shoes can create music with anything on the ground using friction. Each instrument creates a different emotion. Each step creates a different sound. Each instrument has a different personality and they express different emotions when the shoes slide over to make music.</p>

            <h3>Each Surface Has Its Own Voice</h3>
            <p><strong>Pavement</strong> = forced happiness</p>
            <p><strong>Soil</strong> = calm</p>
            <p><strong>Yellow Leaves</strong> = somber, a crying sound but still calm, whispering something. Whispering "it's my time to go."</p>

            <h2>The Journey of Autumn Leaves</h2>
            <p>The autumn leaves land on water so gently.</p>
            
            <p>Somber but calm autumn leaves. They whisper: "It's my time to go." Go where? "Go and become soil. Time to start 修行 (spiritual cultivation)."</p>
            
            <p>They will complete their 修行 when spring comes and they become soil. But they are somber for now because 修行 is so hard. Somber autumn leaves, you will be fine, just go with the flow. Once you become soil, you will 得道 (achieve enlightenment).</p>

            <h2>The Wisdom of Soil</h2>
            <p>But soil is not just calmness, right?</p>
            
            <p>"Yes, you are right," the soil said. "We are also passionate and endure pain. The leaves will need to endure more pain to understand us completely. When spring comes, they will have understood." Some leaves are beginning to understand a bit, but it just takes time. All leaves can do it eventually.</p>
            
            <p>The soil is old and wise. Autumn leaves are young and too passionate, so they are somber.</p>
            
            <p>Young and passionate leaves, you will be alright.</p>

            <h2>The Pavement and Destiny</h2>
            <p>Some leaves decided to land on pavement instead of soil and will never 得道. But is it their choice? They want the forced happiness the pavement provides? But that's not their destiny.</p>
            
            <p>No. They also want to land on soil. But humans have done something to nature and now they can't land on soil.</p>
            
            <p>Humans have done this for their own artificial enjoyment, not considering the leaves' feelings. The leaves provide so much for the humans, but are humans respecting them enough?</p>

            <h2>Rules and Principles</h2>
            <p>My dad's opinion: leaves have rules. Everything on the planet acts according to some rules.</p>
            
            <p>Yes, there are some rules and principles that the leaves act upon. Their rules and principles is to 修行. 修行 is a word that humans created—an imperfect way to describe the process.</p>
            
            <p>修行 is not necessary for all. It is a choice that all can make. Some want the forced happiness but they will never 得道. Others choose the harder path and will find true calmness and love.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Sometimes a blurry look is really nice. Blurriness is like a very foggy day. 若隐若现 (appearing and disappearing)."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>A Question for You</h2>
            <p><strong>What are your thoughts on the purpose of leaves? Write in comments.</strong></p>

            <h2>From Somber to Happy Autumn Leaves <em>(Revised on Oct 18)</em></h2>
            <p>Beneath the Soul Trees in Regent's Park, the fallen leaves make no somber sound, only happy ones. Now, all the leaves rustle with a crisp, joyful voice. They've understood their purpose and are content.</p>
            
            <p>不下雨时，叶子会慢慢变脆； 下雨时，它们腐烂，化作养分，帮助得道。</p>

            <p>尘归尘，土归土。</p>
            
            <p><strong>风与雨在帮助树叶得道。</strong></p>

            <p>正如父亲所说的： 风让它回归大地， 雨让它尘归尘，土归土。</p>
            
            <p>My dad gives me the sprinkle of glitter I need to polish my ideas. ✨</p>
