            <p>Paradoxically, one must forget about survival and focus on the opposite of survival to ensure best survival.</p>

            <p>I think Newton’s third law of motion — <em>for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction</em> — is a fundamental truth of this world. When one acts purely out of self-interest, they sow the seeds of its return, and reaped via the worst of human tragedies.</p>

            <p>What many do today is unsustainable. They take too much, too often, without giving back. This contrasts sharply with some ancient Chinese model, which emphasised harmony and reciprocity. To truly survive, one cannot be selfish. The path to lasting survival lies in genuine altruism. It lies in giving rather than taking.</p>

            <p>Ironically, it is through this selflessness that one gains the most. Yet, even then, personal gain should not be the goal. The best chance of survival comes not from clinging to life, but from transcending the fear of losing it.</p>
