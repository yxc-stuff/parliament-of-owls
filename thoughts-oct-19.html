            <p>This piece represents how I feel walking through the world. A reflection of myself, the modern man, and the society we live in.</p>

            <p>I feel like I always have to cover myself up, leaving only my eyes visible. What I truly want is to live peacefully and do my own thing, but that never seems possible. My right eye still carries traces of hope and anger, while my left eye has surrendered to hopelessness. The X on my body symbolises the pain I've endured; I leave it uncovered as a constant reminder of what I've been through.</p>

            <p>My hands are handcuffed behind my back, showing how I'm restrained by society's constant attention and expectations. My mouth is stitched shut, symbolising how I often feel forced into silence, as if speaking would only bring more unwanted attention.</p>

            <p>The scar running down my face represents the life I once had, before everything changed.</p>

            <h2>The Modern Man</h2>
            <p>To my right stands the "modern man," dressed like a Victorian child. Beneath him are the things he believes he must achieve to be loved today: strength, athletic ability, charisma, and intelligence defined by financial success. Yet this pursuit leaves him sitting alone by a wall, unable to find true love.</p>

            <p>Above him lies what he truly desires: genuine love and connection. But instead, he turns to dating apps, which only make things worse. They reduce love to appearance and wealth, which are shallow measures that strip away real emotion and meaning.</p>

            <h2>The Search for Connection</h2>
            <p>On my left is what I also long for: love and connection. Although I can't help but ask — where is it? Can it still exist in this modern world?</p>
